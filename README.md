This is a TFM project for UNIR


The constant technological increase in the world has made every day more and more users
are connected and interacting through many applications online and in real time about the
topics that interest them most or impact daily. One of these issues is the Environment and its
impact due to so many pollution factors worldwide. This is why this work takes advantage of
one of the platforms with the highest user interaction in opinion and news topics such as
Twitter, trying to capture and analyze the perception that people have about the
environmental impact, performing a sentiment analysis about obtained information, using
libraries such as Tweepy, NumPy and Pandas, in Python language, reaching the end to
compare this information with other data obtained from other pages that prove that climate
change as well as helping the environment is one of the issues that is most compromising to
society with proposals for improvement, being able to be evidenced by graphs that show
users and more representative words as well as the increase in citizen participation about
this topic in general.
